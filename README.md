# Fibonacci Series in Java

## Description
This Java program generates the **Fibonacci series** up to a user-specified number of elements. It uses a simple loop and arithmetic operations to calculate each term in the series. The program demonstrates **user input handling, loops, and basic Java logic**.

## Features
- Accepts input from the user to define the number of elements.  
- Generates and prints the Fibonacci series in order.  
- Uses simple variables and a loop, making it easy to understand.  
- Demonstrates the concept of **iteration** and **sequence generation**.  
- Calculates each Fibonacci term using the previous two terms.  
- Lightweight and beginner-friendly Java program.

## Logic of Fibonacci Program

The program generates the Fibonacci series up to a user-specified number of elements. The logic is as follows:

1. **Take input**  
   - Ask the user to enter the number of terms (`n`) for the series.

2. **Initialize the first two terms**  
   first = 0.
   second = 1.
**Generate the series using a loop*
 **Loop from 1 to n**
In each iteration:
Print the current first term.
Calculate the next term:
next = first + second


**Update the terms for the next iteration:**
first = second
second = next
**Repeat until all n terms are printed**
