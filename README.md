# Fibonacci Series in Java

## Description
This Java program generates the **Fibonacci series** up to a user-specified number of elements. It uses a simple loop and arithmetic operations to calculate each term in the series. The program demonstrates **user input handling, loops, and basic Java logic**.

## Features
- Accepts input from the user to define the number of elements.  
- Generates and prints the Fibonacci series in order.  
- Uses simple variables and a loop, making it easy to understand.  
- Demonstrates the concept of **iteration** and **sequence generation**.  
- Calculates each Fibonacci term using the previous two terms.  
- Lightweight and beginner-friendly Java program.

## Logic
1. **Input**: Take the number of elements (`n`) from the user.  
2. **Initialize**: Set `first = 0` and `second = 1`.  
3. **Loop**: Run from 1 to `n`  
   - Print the current `first` term.  
   - Calculate `next = first + second`.  
   - Update `first = second` and `second = next`.  
4. Repeat until all `n` terms are printed.  

**Example Flow (n = 5):**

| Step | first | second | next | Output |
|------|-------|--------|------|--------|
| 1    | 0     | 1      | 1    | 0      |
| 2    | 1     | 1      | 2    | 1      |
| 3    | 1     | 2      | 3    | 1      |
| 4    | 2     | 3      | 5    | 2      |
| 5    | 3     | 5      | 8    | 3      |
